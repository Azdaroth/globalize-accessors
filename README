EasyGlobalizeAccessors
======================

Generator of easy accessor methods for models using Globalize2.

Use globalize_accessors with list of translated fields you want easy access to and extra :locales array listing locales for which you want the accessors to be generated.

Example
=======

Definition like this:

class Product
  translates :title, :description
  globalize_accessors :title, :description, :locales => [:pl, :en, :de]
end

Gives you access to methods: title_pl, title_en, title_de, title_pl=, title_en=, title_de= (and similar set of description_* methods). And they work seamlessly with Globalize2 (not even touching the "core" title, title= methods used by Globalize2 itself).

TODO
=======

Make it work with full-blown locales including dash character (minus sign) like en-US, en-GB, pl-PL etc.
